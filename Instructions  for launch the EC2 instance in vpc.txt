Launch EC2 instance in Virtual Private Cloud 

ABOUT THIS LAB
	In this lab scenario, Alfredo of Alfredo's Pizza is looking to set up a website to advertise his pizza shop. We are going to help him by getting the server primed and ready to host his website. During this lab, you'll have the opportunity to explore and understand foundational and compute services provided by AWS. We will create a virtual private cloud (VPC), subnets across multiple Availability Zones (AZs), routes and an internet gateway, and more. These services are the foundation of networking architecture inside of AWS and cover concepts such as infrastructure, design, routing, and security.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
	Create a VPC
	Create a Public Subnet
	Create Routes and Configure Internet Gateway
	Launch EC2 Instance in Subnet
	Access EC2 Instance


Instructions:

Step1: create VPC

	Console > VPC> create the VPC > name: “satheesh-vpc” ,  IPV4 CIDR=”manual”, IPv4 CIDR =“10.0.0.0/16” ,
IPv6 CIDR=”No IPV6 CIDR block ”  Tenancy=”shared ”  [create VPC ]

Step2:create a public subnet 

	 VPC > subnet > create subnet >(if) select “satheesh-vpc”,(id there) name= “pub-sub” preference=”us-east-1” ,IPV4 =”10.0.0.0/24” 	[create subnet].




 Step3: Create route and internet gateway

	Select VPC and take action >  modify the auto-assign the IP settings  (Edit subnet settings)  >auto assign ipv4 enable (select) > save 
	Internet Gateway > create Internet gateway > name=”satheesh_IGW” > create internet gateway 

	In InternetGateWay, action> attach to VPC >  select vpc > attach Internet gateway 


	Configure routing 

	Route table > create route table > name=”pub_rt” vpc=”satheesh-vpc”  , create Route Table
	> Edit routes > add routes > destination=”0.0.0.0/0” target=“ igw-satheesh id”    ,save changes

	Allow the internet via IGW

	RT > subnet association > edit  > select route table > save changes  

step4:Launch EC2 instance  in subnet 

	 EC2 : 

	name=”pub-instance”
 	Network traffic=”only allow SSH”    Launch Instance

	Access EC2 instance 

	Select instance > connect > EC2 instance connect > connect > terminal open (if connected )
 	# ls -l
